		<h3>SP Star tactiles</h3> 
        <p>While I have had quite a long time on these switches there is gonna be differences in terminology used for describing feel and most prominently sound. While these reviews will start off as pretty rough I willingly want to improve my writing style and formatting to make it easier for readers new and old for the community to understand and enjoy reading. While these reviews won’t come at Mach ten speeds I will hopefully be able to give people a deciding factor to find their preferred switches in this ever deepening community. Now that I have gotten that out of the way let's get onto the review. </p>
        
        <b>TLDR</b>
        <p>The star purples offer a sharper medium tactile option with snappy upstroke that presents a more refined/clean deep upstroke than its closest competitor the t1 while having better stock performance that could be seen as a good alternative/variant of the t1’s style of short pretravel and higher bump.</p>

        <h3>Switch background</h3>
        <p>While their exact history is hazy we have gotten small snippets about them from zFrontier and other community members. 
        During a time when a majority of switches were JWK/Durock recolours and mould adjustments these switches came out as an interesting alternative to the waves of samey switches. Discovered mid 2020 as a leopold prebuilt switch option it drew members of the community towards it with its possibility of being something new. </p>

        <p>As a collaboration between zFrontier and SP-Star that ended up having their switches offered as a high end switch alternative for Leopold’s prebuilt options perhaps due to unknown manufacturers links to the industry. While it can’t be confirmed for them to have any affiliation with JWK/Durock they are seen as being on par with their quality. With comparisons being drawn with other high end tactiles they were slowly brought over to different markets and spreading out from there.</p>

    <h2>Switch performance</h2>
    <b>Pushfeel</b>
    <p>First thing noticed with these tactiles is their rather more upside down V tactility in relation to other high stem position bumps as it’s felt as a more prominent part of the stroke in comparison to desired trends of smaller pretravel switches having longer more rounded bumps. The lack of sustain during the top of the bump makes the actuation point more noticeable with its fast fall in force after the bumps peak that lasts for longer than the top of the bump. 
        </p>
    <p>The switches upstroke is where I see it excelling by having a more responsive snap with a slightly smoothed top and bottom of the return that can be described as responsive. This responsiveness can be contributed to a sharper return bump than the longer downstroke preventing it from feeling like the tactile equivalent of a clicky kailh box switches sharp pushfeel.	
        </p>
    <p>The smoothness of the purples are above the average stock jwk tactile with no audible scratch when in usage but with a slight what I like to call “fuzz” that is common with nylon switches that isn’t scratchy but more of a surface texture that can be slightly felt. Lube does reduce this feeling significantly but won't be as efficient with removing the feeling from the stem legs but in general you shouldn’t feel it during use. If it's still detrimental to the key feel I would recommend something like an oil or ptfe lube applied thinly to not significantly change the tactile bumps feel if you are not happy with the scratch and would like to reduce it as much as possible. 
        </p>
    <b>Stability</b>
    <p>The housing stability characteristics are on par if not better than JWK offerings at this time with very minor N/S stem wobble and a tiny bit more E/W wobble. When filmed with Durock switch films the N/S is almost completely eliminated with only a little E/W wobble remaining.
