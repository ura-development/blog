        <p> Welcome to my switch blog.  
            While its pretty barren right now I hope to expand it a lot to help people understand what makes switches special, that and I need a place to publish all my analysis and findings on switch housings and stems to make it esaier for people to read and find things out. 
            <br>
            I hope to extend this to general guides for everything someday to help new and old people alike build boards they can be proud of.<br>
