		<h1>Getting started with keyboards</h1> 
        <p>This guide is to help direct new people for all the basics in the hobby. Most of this stuff will be talking budget stuff (sub 300usd total price).
			When asking the question try to say what you want to know (eg switch type and maybe your experience) and what price if you can.</p>
			<br>

                <h3>---SWITCHES---</h3>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> Switches should be decided to match the case as the case is the major varible for sound of a board. A switch in one build can sound completely different in another.</p>
        <p>These are just a few good solid switches to give an idea of what to get in the budget ranges</p>
		<p>- Linears:  <u onclick="location.href='gateron-yellows.html';">Gateron yellows</u> (milky top & full black housing variant preferably), jwick's (ask about them), akko cs/ktt linears, tecsee carrot.</p>
		<p>- Tactiles: KTT tactile/akko CS tactile, jwick tactile, tecsee purple panda.</p>
		<p>- Clickies: Kailh box clickies (box pinks are a good middle ground), aristotle stems in gateron/cherry housing, anything higher priced is not mx switches like alps and that is more specialized (ask if interested in learning).</p>
		<br> 

		<p>Ask around if you want something more specific things as lots of people have tried various switches you might not know of.</p>
		<p>Clickies for mx switches currently make sound 2 ways, a clickbar and a clickjacket. The jacket method is thought to be pretty rattly and bad sounding by most but there are a few good variations that are good if effort is put in but a bit diy (aristotle stems). </p>

        <p>With each price point it’s pretty much a preference of what is wanted sound wise and in key press (tactiles vary a lot).  So watch some videos and see what sounds you like. 
			All switches can be spring swapped (box switches need specific springs for them) to allow for different weighting if stock weight isn't desired.
			Generally the higher the price the better they will be smoother and more sound options.  Some tactiles in lower ranges you might like so really it’s just good to try things. <u onclick="location.href='stabs.html';">Click here for a stabliszer guide.</u></p>

		<h3>--MODDING SWITCHES--</h3>
		<p>Most switches will benefit from lube and films with budgets will be greatly improved. Not needed for a good experience though.
			For what lubes to get - 205g0 for linears, 3203 for tactiles/clickies(clickies are barely lubed much) or kyrtox 104-107 (oils lubes). 3204 works for both linears and tactiles and is a good middle ground if you wanna save money. 
			Lubes will make the switches sound less rattly, often deepen some switches and mute spring/leaf ping issues. Warning it does take some time to learn as you can overlubed at very first but is worth it.
			In the end its preference for what lube but it's good to stick to those to get a feel for them.  
			Videos are better as its better to show visually what to do - </p>

		<p>Films create a better fit for the top and bottom switch housing allowing for better stability (less wobble) of the stem. 
				It will make most switches sound more "full" or just different. If films are wanted just go with 0.15mm films as it will work with almost everything well.</p>
		<br>

		
		<h3>--Stabilizers--</h3>
		<p>More expensive stablizers are usually easier for new people to modify as it saves time and build experince that is needed for other cheaper options that are also great but takes long and more experince to perfect. <br>
		Dielectric grease and 205g0 lube is often recommend for stabs with 205 being used on the plastic on plastic and the dielectric on the wires.<br>
		Mods can be done like Plumbers mod, Tailors mod and "holee". Best to search up guides for these if the stabs need extra love.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>---KEYBOARD CASES---</h3>
		<h4>-Case materials-</h4>
		<p>Metal - Budget metal keyboards are mostly the same quality wise and only can be mounted a few ways due to cost limitations. There are some exceptions like the Bakeneko60 and kbd7x v3. <br>
			Tray mount and integrated plates are gonna be the two major mount types seen that are often only on the lower end. Doesn't mean they are bad as it's a metal case afterall and has a bit of heft to the <br>Polycarbonate - Basically the same as metal but allows for clear cases and is made in similar ways to metal so everything above applies.</p>
			<br>

		<p>Abs/polycarb injection moulding - A relatively new thing in the custom scene, it allows for higher end mount types seen on expensive boards to be brought to budget boards. 
			These different mount types change the feeling of the keypress as well as the sound of the keyboard overall. Most common is gasket mounts with a softer bottom out compared to other mounts.
			They have a different sound and are really just preference for materials best to have a listen to sound tests.</p>

		<p>Fr4 diy kit cases - Fun kits to learn soldering and are cheap! <br>
			https://youtu.be/sfpRtylZL80?t=16032 - have a listen.  Not all good boards have to be expensive</p>
		<br>
		<h3>--Mount styles--<h3>
		<p>	Not gonna go into detail as it's long but each type is a balancing act of feel, sound and cost. Each person is gonna prefer something different but that's why we love customs!</p>
		<img src="KeyboardMountingStylesCheatSheet.png" alt="mountstyles">
		<p> Here is a lil cheat sheet to help with general idea behind each one.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>--Plates--</h3>
		<p>While going plateless is a thing, the majority of people are gonna use a plate to hold switches in place and mount their pcb to the case.
			Each material changes the sound and feel of typing on the keyboard due to flex (also mount) and the plate's material.
			It's best to ask around for how it feels as well as listen to some sound tests.  
			Generally you get either plastic/more flexible plates and to the stiffer side metal plates with each sounding drastically different. Metal is not always best when it comes to this stuff.
			Find what you like!</p>
		<br>
		<h3>--Form factor--</h3>
		<p>Specifies the amount of keys your keyboard will have:<br>
			- 100%: Full keyboard with function keys, navigation section and numpad.<br>
			- 80% or TKL: Usually without numpad, sometimes without the navigation section instead.<br>
			- 75%: Slightly more compact than 80% by excluding some less-used keys.<br>
			- 65%: Has arrow keys and some navigation keys, but with function keys on a layer.<br>
			- 60%: Numpad, function and navigation keys are all on layers.<br>
			There are countless other formats, but these are the most common ones.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>---Keycaps---</h3>
		<p>Well this is a hard one to just decide on as lots of people own different sets because they enjoy them all for different reasons. 
			But to set a baseline majority of prebuilt keyboards (branded keyboards) use oem profile keycaps.
			keycap profiles are the shape that the caps come in and can change drastically the sound and feel. 
			Good starting point is either cherry profile (very similar to oem) or something like xda (good cheap but nice and thick) and SA (very different sound almost vintage styled caps) that have a thocky sound to them. <br>
			They come in two major materials PBT and ABS, there is debate for what is better but its majorly just preference for sound and wear.<br>
			What you will find is there are two good methods of putting fonts on keycaps, dye sub and doubleshot (can do more). <br>
			Only pbt can be dye subbed. Dye sub is often cheaper but can be really high quality and is basically dying the plastic to put it plainly. A example of high end dye sub is crp considered on part with gmk to some.
			Doubleshot is two separate plastics and can be both pbt and abs (more often abs due to pbt limitations and issues).<br>
			Anything that isn't the two methods for fonts as they will wear off and fade with use unlike dye sub and doubleshot.<br>
			PBT and ABS sound different depending on thickness and on each manufacturer so its best to listen to tests and ask around what people think of them.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>HOW TO GET THIS SOUND</h3>
		<p>For people wondering "Can I get clack or this sound" <br>
			Often enough the only way to get the similar sound to what you want is to get the same or very similar product, most high view count sound test vids like taeha types are using higher end keyboards that cost in the 500aud+ ranges.
			This does not mean budget sounds bad, it's just more limited to what sounds can be achieved.</p>
