		<h1>Keyboard stabilisers</h1> 
		<p>Stabs should me modded with the least amount of mods needed to get desired performance and shouldn't be filled to the brim with multiple mods just for the sake of doing so as it doesn't make stabs better automatically.<br> While stabs are some of the most vital and important parts of most keyboards sound wise <b>they aren't meant to get in the way</b> of the switches feel. Stabs can also make or break a keyboard sound wise as they can be the hardest part to tuning a keyboard and takes experince to get it down. Spacebar is the most pressed key on a keyboard so stabs matter.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>--Mods--</h2>
		<p><b>Clipping stabs</b><br>
		Not all but some stabs on the bottoms of their stems have little feet that need when you bottom out on a key press makes the bottom out softer. while this isn't a bad thing for loudness it makes them feel mushy and sound thin. Removing them just needs either a pair of wire cutters or small knife.</p>
		<br><br>

		<p><b>Lubing stabs</b><br>
			The most important thing for tuning stabs as this reduces noise like rattle and tick while also making the stabs smoother making them less noticable. Lube is alwasy done over other mods.<br>
			There is two lubes used on stabs, first the lube for the plastic on plastic parts with the stem and housing. Teflon grease or krytox 205g0/206g0 is most commonly used for stab housings helping reduce friction while its higher vicosity helps reduce rattle. <br> The second is the lube on the wires not to increase smoothness but to dampen and reduce movement of the wire perventing tick and rattle in this sensitive area of the stab. Dielectric (easily obtainable and cheap well loved option) and XHT-BDZ are community favourites and gives the best performance. Regular krytox has issues of wearing off and needing to be reapplied after some time while the the other options last for longer periods of time. <br> <b>Plugging the butt</b> is a lube application method that you use a needle to apply lube into the stab wire ends while still in the board by lifting up the stab stems and injecting into the area.</p>
		<br><br>

		<p><b>Wire balancing</b><br>
			The wire is the second most important part of a stab and can be the majority of issues for people. The act of balacing is placing the wire on a perfectly flat surface and making sure that both sides sit flush against the surface as well as the longer middle part of the wire. To test for how flat it is you have to tap the ends to see if it makes any noise and if it does adjust the stabs acordingly to what dirrection will result in the stabs lying flat. <br>This can take some time to get perfect but is the main cause of tick in most stabs and once learned can help tune even cheap stabs to sound amazing. </p>
			<br><br>

		<p><b>Tailors mod</b><br>
			This mod involves wrapping a thread of wool around the bottom strut of the stabs stem on the part that bottoms out to hold the wires higher in place.<br>
			This mod helps with evening out the depression of the press. This can be tested when pushing down one end of the key and having the bar tilt rather than take the other side end of the key down with it at the start of the press. This issue causes inconsistant sound with the upstroke and sometimes bottom out. Side effect of the mods placement on the stab stem it slightly modifies the bottom out sound to be a little more muted but its often minor and can help with hollowness at times. </p>
			<br><br>
		
		<p><b>Korean galaxy brain/keynoins mod</b><br>
			This mod utilises a film that is present on some stabs like durock v2's and zeal stabs that can be pulled up to act as a leaf to push against the wire to reduce movement and possible tick. This mod is quite advanced so I dirrect you towards <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rt247MZ5Iudf2ZX4iNxzy2KubGbxfjVeINageeH7p5A/edit">Kimchijodyboi's written instructions</a> on this method.</p>
			<br><br>
		
		<p><b>Plumbers mod</b><br>
			Plumbers mod involves wrapping the stab wire's ends with teflon tape or heatshrink to reduce movement like other mods and in turn tick or inconsistant stablisation. Is considerably easier than other mods so is highly recomended as it gets the needed results for most people. </p><br><br>

		<p><b>Holee/espi mod</b><br>
			Holee mod is when a bandaid is cut and placed inside the upper internal roof of the stabs stems preventing tick and sometimes upstroke inconsistancy. It comes with the drawbad of being alot more fidily than plumbers as well as leading to a mushy feeling that can go away with time.<br> Espi mod is a variant done with deskeys film scraps and doublesided tape on top and bottom of the internal area in the stem. Its more consistant but does need deskey films. Overall its a harder mod but can help if a silent board is being used. If the stabs were lubed previously its recomended to clean it well so the tape sticks. </p>
				<br><br>
		
		<p><b>Pcb baindaid or foam stab pads</b><br>
			Basically just puttting a bandaid or foam pad (inbluded with some stabs and boards) that silences/mutes bottom out noise. The bandaid method isn't recomended anymore as it leads to a very mushy bottom and sometimes wont let the stabs sit straight on the pcb leading to issues sound and smoothness wise. Foam pad variant is recomended if the stabs don't rattle but you want a more silent/muted bottom out. Heavily recomended for silent boards and can be easily removed. </p>
			<br><br>
		
		<p><b>Dry hump</b><br>
			With a weird name like that its gonna raise some eyebrows. The mod involves no lube at all and in one of the variants. It involves using PTFE plumbers and PTFE fiberglass tape. The first variant you only put fiberglass tape onto the inside of the stem for the wire in the same places as the epsi mod and then lubing the housings. <br>The full dry hump mod is using tape on the stab housings as well to have a fully lubeless stabs. This may lead to scratchyness but its a interesting mod anyway. Learn how to do it here on <a href="https://thockpop.com/guides/dry-hump-your-stabilizers/">Thockpop's website</a>.   </p>
