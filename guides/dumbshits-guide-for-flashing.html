		<h1>Dumbshits guide to flashing a keyboard</h1> 
        <p>Starting notes<br>
			- hex file: a file that ends with '.hex'. <br>
			- reset button: the nub thingy at the back of your kb, if you can't see it, see anywhere with 2 holes saying 'rst' or 'reset'<br>
			- some keyboards are already flashed with a via hex and you just have to download via and sometimes upload a '.json' file<br>
			</p>
			<br>

                <h3>Step 1:</h3>
				<p>Download the keyboards hex file you need. If you are wanting via for your board download off. <br>
					https://caniusevia.com/docs/download_firmware#0 if its on the list or if its said to be via compatible the product page/owners resources (not all boards have via compatability).
					</p> <br>

				<h3>Step 2:</h3>
				<p>Download qmk toolbox for your os (supports unix, windows and mac) and install it.
					Make sure to say yes to installing drivers.</p>
					<br>
				<h3>Step 3:</h3>
				<p>Open up qmk toolbox and select your boards microcontroller. <br>
					Most boards are atmega32a4's.</p> <br>

				<h3>Step 4:</h3>
				<p>Find the keyboards "reset" button on the pcb or sites mentioned keys to hold for resetting.
For holding keys you have to hold the key or combination while plugging in the keyboard. <br>
For the reset button just press it. <br>
After the keyboard has a reset it should show this </p> <br>
				<h3>Step 5:</h3> 
				<p>Select the file on your computer that has been downloaded from step 1 </p> <br>
					<br>
				<p>If you have done all the steps before press flash. <br>
					It should show up like this</p> <br>

				<p>You now have a flashed keyboard.<br>
					unplug and replug and it should be working as intended.
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
